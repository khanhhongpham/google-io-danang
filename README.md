If you use cloud sql (postgres) for the database you will also need `file.json` to provide access to the database via service account. This can be obtained from the IAM tab in the GCP console by navigating IAM > Service Accounts and creating one with a JSON key. Donâ€™t forget to add the Cloud SQL Client role to this service account in the IAM tab
